# Trackmania Map Border Highlighter

This plugin for Trackmania visually represents the borders of a map by drawing lines at the edges of the main playable area.

## Overview

The Map Border Highlighter enhances the player's experience by clearly marking the boundaries of the game map.

## Features

- **Dynamic Border Rendering:** Draws lines around the perimeter of the map, scaling to any size.
- **Opacity Scaling:** Line opacity changes based on the distance from the player to provide a clearer view of the immediate surroundings.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Users can customize the color and thickness of the border lines through settings.
- **Toggle Visibility:** Players can easily toggle the visibility of the border lines during gameplay.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Limitations:** The highlighter assumes standard block sizes to calculate the map borders. Mods that change block dimensions may affect accuracy.
2. **Performance Impact:** Rendering many line segments can impact game performance on lower-end systems.
3. **Compatibility:** Designed for the latest version of Trackmania; compatibility with future updates cannot be guaranteed.
